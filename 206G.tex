\begin{itemize}
  \item A strategy profile is an assignment of strategies for each player
  \item A pure strategy is discrete: either north or south for example
  \item A mixed Nash equilibrium is the best outcome for both players when they're using mixed strategies (where the strategy is a probability of going north or south rather than a discrete north or south choice).
  \item A simplex is when each component adds to 1, e.g. $x+y=1$ $\leftarrow$ 2 strategy game.
  \item $\sigma$ is a mixed profile
  \item $x=f(x)$ is a fixpoint
  \item Brouwer fixpoint theorem
  \item Kakutani fixpoint theorem
  \item Every $n$-player game has at least one Nash equilibrium.
  \item Sperner's Lemma:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Pick an arbitrary set of $n-1$ colors (letâ€™s say red and blue)
      \item Count red-blue edges after slicing simplex along cutlines
      \item Count exterior edges (call it $a$)
      \item Count interior edges twice (call it $b$)
      \item Total count is $a + 2b$
